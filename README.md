Loan Calculator
You are given the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a loan calculator. Your goal is to fill in the JavaScript to make the loan calculator functional. The calculator takes an amount to loan (the principle), a term in years, and a yearly rate. The output should be the monthly payment of the loan.

To calculate the monthly payment, use the following formula:

monthly payment=P×i1−(1+i)−n
Where:

P = Amount of principle
i = periodic interest rate (in our case yearly rate ÷ 12)
n = total number of payments (years × 12)
There is also a jasmine test file (calculator-test.js). Your goal is to write tests for the calculateMontlyPayment function. There are a few suggested tests, but if you can think of more, feel free to add to it.

Further Study: Tip Pool
In this exercise you will take an existing code base and write tests using the Jasmine testing library.

‘Tip Pool’ is an application that tracks the total tips generated from a group of servers in a restaurant. It then calculates the payout for each server.

Your task is to thoroughly test each function in the app!

Step One: Complete server.test.js
Take a minute to read through the codebase, currently there is only one test in server.test.js

Notice that the string ‘Alice’ is getting left on the dom after the first test is run, this is because we didn’t tear down our tests properly

To get started:

Thoroughly read the code base
Clean up the dom after the test is run using afterEach
Write a test for each function found in server.js
Step Two: Test the remainder of the app
Repeat the process from step one for payments.js and helpers.js

Create a helpers.test.js file and test each function in helpers.js
Create a payments.test.js file and test each function in payments.js
When finished you should have three .test.js files one for each .js file
Step Three: Test your own code
Get a feel for testing your own code

First we will build out functionality for removing a server from the server table

Review the functionality of appendTd(tr, value)

Create a appendDeleteBtn(tr), it will be similar to append(tr, value). This function will create a ‘td’ with the value ‘X’, when clicked it will delete the table row it belongs to

Write the functionality for appending a ‘td’ to a ‘tr’ with the value ‘X’

Set an click event listener on the ‘td’ that will remove the parent ‘tr’ from the dom. You will have to find a way to access the parent row of the ‘td’ from the click event

Write tests for appendDeleteBtn(tr)

You may notice the difficulty of simulating a click with vanilla javascript so do not spend too much time on testing the html after the DOM is updated (later we will study approaches for this with other libraries).

Repeat the process for removing a payment from the payment table
